Prototype A uses three activities (and a splash-screen activity) as follows:

LaunchAppActivity: 
The user can select an installed application from a list to launch.
If the user selects an application, a dialog is displayed to confirm the selection.
Confirming the choice transitions into the next activity, RecordActivity

RecordActivity:
This activity immediately launches the target application for the bug report.
This activity also launches a data collection async task.
Upon return to this activity, the user can submit a benchmark description or stop recording.
Selecting "stop recording" transitions to the next activity, SubmitReportActivity.

SubmitReportActivity:
The user can input their name, the report title, and a brief description of the report.
Selecting "submit" sends the data to the server and terminates the application.
