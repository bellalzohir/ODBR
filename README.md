# On-device Record Replay for Android Applications

## Project Description:

This project was created by the Software Engineering Maintenance and Evolution Research Unit (SEMERU) at the College of William & Mary, under the supervision of Dr. Denys Poshyvanyk.  The major goal of the ODBR project is to provide a practical automated bug-reporting tool to developers that is capable accurately recording and replaying a set of actions that will reproduce a bug that surfaces in a mobile application directly on a physical or virtual Android device.  This repository contains the code for the Android Application that performs the recording and replaying of captured bug reports on a device.
